# 📌 Advanced Data Engineering: Project Plan & README

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project explores key trends in North, Central, and South America, focusing on **population growth and unemployment rates** in the United States (2020–2023). The goal is to analyze correlations between demographic changes and labor market trends using real-world datasets.

## 📊 Datasets & Sources
We will use the following datasets:

### 1️⃣ **U.S. Population Estimates (2020–2023)**  
- **Source:** United States Census Bureau  
- **Metadata URL:** [Census Metadata](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2020-2023/state/totals/)  
- **Data URL:** [Population Data (CSV)](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2020-2023/state/totals/NST-EST2023-ALLDATA.csv)  
- **Description:** Provides annual population estimates per state, including births, deaths, and migration trends.  

### 2️⃣ **U.S. Unemployment Rates (2020–2023)**  
- **Source:** Department of Labor & Iowa State University  
- **Metadata URL:** [Labor Data](https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/employment/unemployment-states)  
- **Data URL:** [Unemployment Data (XLSX)](https://dlt.ri.gov/media/15101/download?language=en)  
- **Description:** Contains annual unemployment rates for each U.S. state, allowing for trend analysis.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Process
During the data cleaning process, we performed the following steps:
- **Removed duplicates** to ensure unique records.
- **Handled missing values** by filling gaps using appropriate statistical methods.
- **Standardized column names and formats** for consistency.
- **Converted data types** where necessary to facilitate analysis.
- **Checked for outliers and anomalies** to maintain data integrity.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand key trends and insights:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms and boxplots were used to analyze the distribution of population and unemployment rates.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps were created to explore relationships between variables.
- **Findings**:
  - Population distribution is **right-skewed**, with some states having very high populations.
  - Unemployment rates are **normally distributed**, with some states experiencing higher-than-average rates.
  - **No strong correlation** was found between population size and unemployment rate.
