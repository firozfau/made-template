# Project Plan

## Title
<!--project a short title. -->
“The Americas” (Projects with relation to North-, Middle- or South-America)

## Main Question

<!-- One main question I want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Is the unemployment rate in the USA growing at a faster rate than the population from 2020 to 2023? If so, what factors might be contributing to this trend?


## Description

<!-- Here try to short describe of my project, I consider writing about why and how I attempt it. -->
The "Americas" project is focused on exploring and understanding key issues that connect North, Central, and South America. With regions so rich in diversity but facing shared challenges, this project addresses how countries across the Americas can work together on topics like climate change,economic, trade, and cultural exchange.

The analysis focuses on determining whether the unemployment rate in the USA has been growing at a faster rate than the population from 2020 to 2023. The hypothesis is that external economic factors may have a more significant impact on unemployment rates compared to natural population growth alone.

The project seeks to understand the dynamics behind this trend by analyzing data on both population estimates and unemployment rates. By identifying patterns and potential contributing factors, the goal is to provide insights that can help policymakers and researchers better understand the factors driving changes in the U.S. labor market.

Ultimately, the analysis aims to uncover whether shifts in unemployment are driven more by economic conditions rather than demographic changes, which can inform future strategies for economic stability and workforce planning

## Datasources

<!-- Here is a list of data sources with brief descriptions, all relevant to achieving the project goals.-->

### Datasource-1: This dataset source from  United Stated CensusBureau(2020 - 2023)
* Metadata URL: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2020-2023/state/totals/
* Data URL: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2020-2023/state/totals/NST-EST2023-ALLDATA.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides annual population estimates for U.S. states and regions from 2020 to 2023. It includes detailed information on factors like births, deaths, and migration, which contribute to population changes. This data is used to analyze population growth trends and demographic shifts across the United States.


### Datasource-2: This dataset source form data source Department of Labor and Training and  Iowa State University of Science and Technology(2020 - 2023)
* Metadata URL:  https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/employment/unemployment-states
